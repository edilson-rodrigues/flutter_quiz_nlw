## Second day #NLW 5 - Flutter Quiz

We ended the home UI with statistical data.
At that moment I faced a problem with overflow in the QuizCard widget, the resolution was to use mediaquery. It was very good on my physical device and on my emulator.

We also created the dynamic questions screen, receiving the appropriate values, signaling the correct, wrong and standard questions.

We create models for the scenario of our application.
